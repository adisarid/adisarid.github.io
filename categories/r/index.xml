      <description>Following Jenny Bryan’s talk on tidyeval in the last rstudio::conf 2019, I decided to write this short note (mainly as a reminder to myself).
What is tidyeval?Tidy evaluation, or non standard evaluation, allows us to pass column names between functions. This is the “classic” behaviour of most tidyverse functions. For example, we use:
library(tidyverse)mtcars %&amp;gt;% select(mpg, cyl)## mpg cyl## Mazda RX4 21.0 6## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.</description>

      <description>First, let me start by saying wow!, what a wonderful experience.
When I booked the trip from Israel to Austin, TX, I thought that I’ll see some good content, and learn at the conference (as I in fact did). It was much more enjoyable than I could’ve imagined. In part I guess this can be contributed to the awesome R community. The ease in which you start a conversation with just about anyone in the conference - about R, professional life (or even personal life), that’s great.</description>
