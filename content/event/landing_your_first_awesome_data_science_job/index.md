abstract: Getting a job is a job of its own. You need to prepare, research and make sure you make the best impression. Sometimes all you get is one chance. In the lecture I will give you some pointers for preparing yourself towards entry-level positions in data science related jobs. I will cover aspects of preparation, portfolio generation, interviews, and negotiation.
