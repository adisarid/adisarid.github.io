abstract: "Being a data scientist and partner at a market research institute brings a different perspective: instead of working on a specific set of products, or a specific domain (like many data science and machine learning positions in the industry), you get to experience a very wide range of domains and projects, depending on the clients you have. In this talk, I will share my 10+ years of experience working as a partner in a research institute, and show some diverse examples of research that worked out well, but more importantly, the ones that didnâ€™t. I will outline some of the mistakes and the lessons to be learned from them. The talk will bounces between the business and technical worlds but does not assume any prior theoretical knowledge."
