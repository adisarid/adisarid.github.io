# Raw

   * From the `tidymodels` workshop: the `vetiver` package for deploying models in a `plumber` API.
   
   * The `butcher` package makes models slimmer towards deployment (e.g., removing the data from the model)
   
   * The `stacks` package for stacking different models.
   
   * The `required.packages` from (some) package within `tidymodels` can be used on an object to see which packages are needed to predict it. Can be useful for migrating models to other repos (without the overhead of the complete `tidymodels`).
