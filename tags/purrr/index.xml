      <description>With all the functional programming going on (i.e., purrr::map and the likes), there is at least one thing that I found missing: progress bars. The plyr::do function had a nice looking progress bar open up by default if the operation took more than 2 seconds and had at least two more to go (as per Hadleyâ€™s description in Issue#149 in tidyverse/purrr).
The issue is still open, for the time of writing these lines, and will probably be solved sometime in the near future as a feature of purrr::map.</description>
