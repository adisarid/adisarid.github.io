      <description>A few months ago I attended the 2019 rstudio::conf, including the shiny train-the-trainer workshop. It was a two day workshop and it inspired me in many ways. The first day of the workshop focused on the very basics of teaching (R or anything else), and for me it put the spotlight on things I never considered before.
One of the important takeways from the workshop was how to approach educating others: preparing for a course, things you can do during the lessons, and how to self-learn and improve my own teaching methods afterwards.</description>
