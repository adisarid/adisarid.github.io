This is the “classic” behaviour of most tidyverse functions. For example, we use:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\rmtcars %\u0026gt;% select(mpg, cyl)\r## mpg cyl\r## Mazda RX4 21.0 6\r## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6\r## Datsun 710 22.8 4\r## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6\r## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8\r## Valiant 18.1 6\r## Duster 360 14.3 8\r## Merc 240D 24.4 4\r## Merc 230 22.8 4\r## Merc 280 19.2 6\r## Merc 280C 17.8 6\r## Merc 450SE 16.4 8\r## Merc 450SL 17.3 8\r## Merc 450SLC 15.2 8\r## Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4 8\r## Lincoln Continental 10.4 8\r## Chrysler Imperial 14.7 8\r## Fiat 128 32.4 4\r## Honda Civic 30.4 4\r## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4\r## Toyota Corona 21.5 4\r## Dodge Challenger 15.5 8\r## AMC Javelin 15.2 8\r## Camaro Z28 13.3 8\r## Pontiac Firebird 19.2 8\r## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4\r## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4\r## Lotus Europa 30.4 4\r## Ford Pantera L 15.8 8\r## Ferrari Dino 19.7 6\r## Maserati Bora 15.0 8\r## Volvo 142E 21.4 4\rThe two variables were selected out of the mtcars data set, and we specified them as names without using any quotation marks. They are symbolic, not characters (although they could also be specified as characters, select is smart enough that way).\nBut assume we want to pass variables “tidy style” between functions which do different operations.\n\rVariation one - a basic example\rWe’ll start simple: a function which has two parameters. The first parameter is a dataset. The second parameters is a grouping variable. All other variables in the data set will have their mean computed using summarize_all.\ntest1 \u0026lt;- function(dataset, groupby_vars){\rgrouping_vars \u0026lt;- enquo(groupby_vars)\rdataset %\u0026gt;% group_by(!! grouping_vars) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize_all(funs(mean(.))) %\u0026gt;%\rreturn()\r}\rmtcars %\u0026gt;%\rselect(cyl:carb) %\u0026gt;%\rtest1(groupby_vars = cyl)\r## # A tibble: 3 x 10\r## cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 4 105. 82.6 4.07 2.29 19.1 0.909 0.727 4.09 1.55\r## 2 6 183. 122. 3.59 3.12 18.0 0.571 0.429 3.86 3.43\r## 3 8 353. 209. 3.23 4.00 16.8 0 0.143 3.29 3.5\rWe can see that mtcars was grouped by cyl which was passed as a name (not characters). The function test1 took it, then enquo()-ed it, and eventually used it in the tidy chain using !!.\rThe function enquo turns the input into a “quosure”. Then the !! “uses” the quosure to select the proper variable from mtcars.\n\rPassing arguments using ...\rA slightly more complex situation is passing multiple arguments to the function. Assume that this time we want to construct a function which gets one input by which to group by, and what are the variables to be summarized:\ntest2 \u0026lt;- function(dataset, groupby_vars, ...){\rgrouping_vars \u0026lt;- enquo(groupby_vars)\rdataset %\u0026gt;% group_by(!! grouping_vars) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize_at(vars(...), funs(mean(.))) %\u0026gt;%\rreturn()\r}\rmtcars %\u0026gt;%\rselect(cyl:carb) %\u0026gt;%\rtest2(groupby_vars = cyl, disp:drat)\r## # A tibble: 3 x 4\r## cyl disp hp drat\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 4 105. 82.6 4.07\r## 2 6 183. 122. 3.59\r## 3 8 353. 209. 3.23\rWhat happend is that test2 treats the grouping variable the same way that test1 treated it, but it also passed along the variables disp:drat.\n\rMaximum flexibility - multiple enquo()s\rSometime passing the dots, i.e., ... is not enough.\rFor example, if we want specify behaviour for different columns of the data frame (e.g., compute the mean for some and the std for others). In such cases we need a more flexible version. We can extend the flexibilty of this approach using multiple enqou()s.\ntest3 \u0026lt;- function(dataset, groupby_vars, computemean_vars, computestd_vars){\rgrouping_vars \u0026lt;- enquo(groupby_vars)\rmean_vars \u0026lt;- enquo(computemean_vars)\rstd_vars \u0026lt;- enquo(computestd_vars)\rdataset %\u0026gt;% group_by(!! grouping_vars) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize_at(vars(!!mean_vars), funs(mean(.))) %\u0026gt;%\rleft_join(dataset %\u0026gt;%\rgroup_by(!! grouping_vars) %\u0026gt;%\rsummarize_at(vars(!!std_vars), funs(sd(.))))\r}\rmtcars %\u0026gt;% test3(groupby_vars = cyl, disp:drat, wt:carb)\r## Joining, by = \u0026quot;cyl\u0026quot;\r## # A tibble: 3 x 10\r## cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 4 105. 82.6 4.07 0.570 1.68 0.302 0.467 0.539 0.522\r## 2 6 183. 122. 3.59 0.356 1.71 0.535 0.535 0.690 1.81 ## 3 8 353. 209. 3.23 0.759 1.20 0 0.363 0.726 1.56\rIn the resulting table, the first column cyl is the grouping variable, columns disp through drat have the mean of the corresponding variables, and columns wt through carb have their standard deviation computed.\n\rAdditional uses of tidy evaluation\rThis evaluation is very useful when building flexible functions, but also when using the ggplot2 syntax within functions, and more so when using Shiny applications, in which input parameters need to go in as grouping or as plotting parameters.\nHowever, this is a topic for a different post.\n\rConclusions\rTidy evaluation empowers you with great tools - it offers a great degree of flexibilty, but it’s a bit tricky to master.\nMy suggestion is that if you’re trying to master tidy evaluation, just think about your use case: which of the three variations presented in this post it resembles too?\nWork your way up - from the simplest version (if it works for you) and up to the complex (but most flexible) version.\n\r","date":1547985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547985600,"objectID":"bffee4df110f883415ea043910de9482","permalink":"/post/2019-01-20-short-note-about-tidy-eval/","publishdate":"2019-01-20T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-01-20-short-note-about-tidy-eval/","section":"post","summary":"Following Jenny Bryan’s talk on tidyeval in the last rstudio::conf 2019, I decided to write this short note (mainly as a reminder to myself).\nWhat is tidyeval?\rTidy evaluation, or non standard evaluation, allows us to pass column names between functions.

It was much more enjoyable than I could’ve imagined. In part I guess this can be contributed to the awesome R community. The ease in which you start a conversation with just about anyone in the conference - about R, professional life (or even personal life), that’s great.\nBesides that, visiting Texas (for the first time) was interesting, but for more on that - see venue.\nWorkshop “Shiny Train-the-Trainer”\rThis was a two day workshop. The first day was taught by Greg Wilson, and touched different points of teaching in general, and teaching programming lanugages. The second day was taught by Mine, and zoomed-in on Shiny apps and how to teach building Shiny apps.\nStarting from the theory and building up, Greg was very charismatic. For me, some takeaways from the workshop were:\n\rEach time you start a new course, choose 1-2 things you want to improve/tryout. Don’t try to go “all-in” because then you might miss. Also, make sure that when you do implement new techniques, you don’t fall short on things you were doing so far which were good.\r\rThis is going to be slightly cumbersome (I’m also summarizing this for my own good).\nA few things that helps organize and conduct sessions.\nFigure out who are your learners\rFigure out who are your learners: what are they interested in? what do they already know, and what they don’t know. What is the diversity you’re going to get in the crowd (persona analysis).\nHere’s are examples for different personas we cooked up during the workshop.\nA shiny novice\r\rBackground: Statisticians and Data Scientists from the pharma industry.\rPrior knowledge: Some knowledge but not state of the art.\rMotivation: Want to build shiny apps to share information with other functions in the company.\rHow the course will help them: Able to build simple shiny apps and grow from there.\rSpecial needs: “Think they know but actually don’t”.\r\r\rA shiny expert\r\rBackground: New company moving from a start-up. Biostatistics PhD.\rPrior knowledge: Used R, made apps for paper presentations, done some shiny apps. Looks good but they know that there are stuff that they don’t know. Mix of formal (for the statistics) but a lot of fun learning on their own.\rMotivation: Utilize what they have done, but in the context of the organization, and learn about new and cool things.\rHow the course will help them: Teach them the newest and best things of Shiny, in the context of the company. This is how make it production and enterprise ready.\rSpecial needs: Work from home. Interaction remote. Dog that barks. Online course.\r\r\rA student you expect to encounter at a shiny workshop you teach\r\rBackground: Danny is studying industrial engineering. Undergrad. He is in his third year, and about to finish next year. He likes data science and likes aquiring new programming skills.\rPrior knowledge: Danny has learned some python and some base R, throghout the last few semsters, but he is not fluent in either. Still struggling with some commands in R.\rMotivation: Danny wants to aquire a new tools that will help him next year when he looks for new work, and will help him impress potential employers.\rHow the course will help them: Danny will be able to build apps and use them as showcase while he is looking for work next year. In addition, he will be able to build shiny apps that will help him publish and distribute findings.\rSpecial needs: Danny has a lot of motivation, but is a novice to R and programming in general. He doesn’t have a lot of time for exercise because the semster courses take up a lot of his time, nonetheless, he is willing to invest the time in projects at specific “peaks” in order to advance his skills.\r\r\r\rWrite the learning objectives\rWrite learning objectives which are observable (by the learners) and also measureable. For example:\nThe student will build a shiny app that does…\rThe students will learn and use the renderPlot() function, etc.\r\rHere’s another example for learning objectives of a short introductory 1-hour session:\nThe students will understand the basic elements of a shiny app and describe the difference between ui, server and global.\rThe students will apply the princibles to modify an example reading a file and showing a table with the first 10 lines of the file.\rThe students will learn about and be aware of shiny examples in the gallery.\r\rTo formulate the objectives, one can use bloom’s taxonomy (and the extended version of it that Mine have shown during class).\n\rBuild conceptual maps\rBuild concept maps for each of the topics in the course. I.e., for each class there is a concept map that highlights the topics and the connections between them. Again, referring to the steps in Bloom’s taxonomy as the building blocks of those building blocks. While building the concept maps, remmember that:\n\rRoughly 5-9 items can fit in the short term memory. Consider that when building the concept map. Make sure it’s not too complicated.\rTo make things slightly easier, while teaching, you can use a whiteboard to expand the concept map and show the class where we are on the concept map.\r\r\rWrite the “final exam” and formative assesments\rWrite the final exam, i.e., in the end of the session, what should they be able to answer? This should correspond to the aferomentioned learning objectives.\nGenerate formative assesments (short questions for “check-ins”), that will be used during the lesson. These will help you check if the crowd is with you or lost got lost.\n\rCreate the presentation and learning materials\rFinally, create the learning material around the previous steps. Re-iterate as needed to improve the materials.\n\rSome more useful tools and tips\r\rSticky notes are very useful during programming lessons. This way you can see during the lesson where the class is at. Have 4 colors:\r\rGreen = “everything is fine”\rRed = “need help”\rBlue = “want a break”\rOrange = “want to ask a question”\r\rFor “check-ins” You can use poll everywhere or a similar solution.\rInteractions between students are very useful. Ask a question. Let them talk with one another to get the answer.\r“Baby steps” - use faded examples or incremental examples when teaching. Avoid a “novice blank page” when starting.\rEncourage the students: “what would you type into stackoverflow to find a solution to this problem?”\rNo opting-out. If someone doesn’t know the answer, ask someone else - then go back to that person and ask something else. No one will “fall asleep”, you make sure that everyone are with you. Jump between locations in class (not in the sitting order).\rUse rstudio.cloud when a uniform R environment is desired. We can even start from a flat base instance with all the packages pre-loaded.\r\r\rFeedback\r\rChoose an element from above. Use feedback to understand if it was good or not. Choose an existing thing you do and check that you didn’t lose it either.\rEncourage the students to give feedback to one another by interacting in exercises (can scale up to larger classes).\r\r\rFurther reading\rCheck the online materials of the course. Everything is on a creative commons - BY RStudio - license.\nAll resources for teaching techniques are available at Greg Wilson’s website teachtogether.tech.\nResources specific for Shiny teaching are available at the workshop’s website, including Mine’s teaching notes for 1hr, 2hr, 1/2day, 1day, 2day workshops. See http://teach-shiny.rbind.io.\n\r\rConference Day 1\rHere are some highlights:\n\rJoe Chang’s keynote: lots of tools for testing and profiling shiny apps. Speed improvments for shiny apps using cache (plotCacheRender()). Showd some techniques to make apps much quicker.\rAPI development with R and Tensor flow at T-mobile: A really cool use case for using shiny apps and plumber API. This is an example for scaling up a plumber api for a customer facing app.\rDatabases using R: the latest: Edgar demonstrated how he connects to a google big query database. The big query server does all the computations and the clean (and smaller data) is input into R for continued analysis. Very cool.\rWorking with categorial data in R without loosing your mind: some best practices for working with factors. Advocating forecats (actually much of these I already implement in my work anyhow).\rMelt the clock: tidy time series analysis: a talk about tsibble and fable, the packages which are about to replace the forecast and ts(), in a tidy-er version. Can be installed from github and should make life much easier for time series analysis.\r3D mapping, plotting, and printing with rayshader: an extremely cool package for ploting maps from x-y-z (elevation data). A lot of options, and even includes an export for 3d printing of the models.\rgganimate Live Cookbook: A nice package for animating ggplots. But need to carefully choose when to use and when not to use it…\r\r\rConference Day 2\rGreat RMarkdown session - kind of made me rethink about how I do my work. For me personally a lot of the work envolves power point and word, but from now on, I think I’ll try to do it on RMarkdown. More reproduceable, easier to recreate, or update if needed.\n\rYihui Xie talked about blogdown, bookdown, and more recently pagedown (for academic publications). I also came to know about Radix - a package for Academic style blogs. In the new RStudio (version 1.2 and above, currently in preview), there is an option to export RMarkdown documents into power point presentation. Works seamlessly, just change the yaml at the top:\r\r---\rtitle: \u0026quot;This is a power point presentation\u0026quot;\rauthor: \u0026quot;I\u0026#39;m the author\u0026quot;\rdate: \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;\routput: powerpoint_presentation\r---\r\rThe gt package was presented. A package which is great for generating html or \\(\\LaTeX\\) tables.\rA cool feature of RMarkdown which I didn’t know about is parameters. It enables to creat variants of an RMarkdown document without actually changing the document. For more info see parameterized reports.\rHadley Wikam talked about a new package in development vctrs that is supposed to improve type consistency in R. Here’s an example with factor and c’s default behaviour vs. the vec_c solution in vctrs:\r\rc(factor(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;), factor(\u0026quot;b\u0026quot;))\r## [1] 1 1\rvctrs::vec_c(factor(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;), factor(\u0026quot;b\u0026quot;))\r## [1] a b\r## Levels: a b\r\rJenny Bryan talked about lazy evaluation. Finally made some sense to me about when to use enquo() and when to use !!.\rAnother good talk about the ipc package for Shiny apps which require heavy and async computations. That package is able to pass queue and interrupt messages between processes.\rDavid Robinson from DataCamp gave a really inspiring talk about what you can and should do openly (hence me writing this blog post, in the hopes that it’ll be the first of many).\r\r\rVenue\rI landed on Monday and the workshops started on Tuesday, so not too much time to hand around, but following the recommendation of the receptionist in my hotel (which was great, Holiday Inn Austin Town Center), I went to Terry Black’s - an original BBQ resteraunt, which was very good (apparantly also very high on TripAdvisor).\nI also checked out the South of Colorado (SoCo) area - it was nice to walk around and by some small things for the wife and kids.\nParks around the Colorado River - real nice to walk around or jog.\n\rTakeaways\r\rUse more RMarkdown and less powerpoint/word.\rLot of tips on how to improve my R courses (which I should implement).\rShiny is extremly powerful, much more than what I’m using today. Should probably find the time to improve my own Shiny building/programming skills.\rDo a lot more blogging with R and blogdown.\r\r\r","date":1547899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547899200,"objectID":"6f8148aadf5bfaf4a5f5fb1d8d604df3","permalink":"/post/2019-01-19-rstudio-conf-recap/","publishdate":"2019-01-19T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-01-19-rstudio-conf-recap/","section":"post","summary":"First, let me start by saying wow!, what a wonderful experience.\nWhen I booked the trip from Israel to Austin, TX, I thought that I’ll see some good content, and learn at the conference (as I in fact did).

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372626000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372626000,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne\r Two\r Three\r\nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
